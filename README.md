#Casper University

This is a website developed using basic HTML,CSS,JS,JQuery by myself for the final year project in college
This was developed on Aug-Jun 2018
Back then as i had only basic knowledge of Web Programming ,I couldnt give my 100%. Everything you see in the porject took me hours and hours to implement as my knowldge of HTML,CSS very less.
As the ASP.Net was the backend , I had to remove it completely as it is just a prototype , But it had a cool feature when people could send message and it would be mailed to my account.
